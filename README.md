Predictions using TensorFlow/ Keras

Using input data from a printing house, the model tries to predict the time needed for each process. New data is being collected at the beginning of each month (usually), so it's safe to assume that the precision of the model will continue to rise.

The end-result would be creating a model precise enough to be used in real-life industry-level situations. To do so, the model would need to be precise enough, but more importantly, the maximum loss should be held to a minimum. In other words, it's better to be a little 'off' with every prediction, than to be exactly right with almost every prediction, but far 'off' with some of them.

Still a work in progress :)

TO DO LIST:
- create a better, easier way to introduce new input data to the model
